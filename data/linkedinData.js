We've pioneered many of the most advanced and successful Agile methods of software development and best practices used in the industry today. <br /> <br /> In other words we build (amazing) software. Itâ€™s amazing because we build it with a complete obsession on doing the right thing for the user and the customer and some quirky methods to get us there really quickly. Itâ€™s also amazing because itâ€™s the stuff which makes or breaks companies; software which creates competitive advantage. <br /> <br /> But thatâ€™s only part of the story. ThoughtWorks is a social and commercial community based on three pillars â€“ (1) running a sustainable business -- which enables us to (2) deliver software excellence and (3) advocate for positive social change. <br /> <br /> We see building software as a social activity best done by teams of brilliant people not a mechanistic process where individuals are interchangeable cogs in a master plan. Our hiring model focuses on finding outstanding talent over the mastery of tools. <br /> <br /> Since 1993 ThoughtWorks has grown from a small group of passionate people our founder Roy Singham gathered in a factory-district office in Chicago to a company spread across twelve countries: Australia Brazil Canada China Ecuador Germany India Singapore South Africa Turkey Uganda the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>","website":"http://www.thoughtworks.com"},
