    "lnkd_description":"The U.S. Navy is comprised of more than 500,000 Sailors and civilians, nearly 300 ships and submarines, and more than 3,700 aircraft. Our Sailors serve on the water (aboard ships); under the water (aboard submarines); over the water (in planes and helicopters) and away from the water (ashore in the U.S. and around the world). What happens on the water affects us all. To understand the impact the U.S. Navy makes in our daily lives, think of the 70-80-90 rule. Seventy percent of the earth is covered by water, 80 percent of the earth's population lives near the ocean, and 90 percent of international trade travels by sea. The U.S. Navy meets threats far away, so those threats cannot harm our citizens at home. They protect and defend freedom around the world and also offer opportunities for a great career. If you'd like to learn more about serving in America's Navy, visit navy.com or call 800-USA-NAVY (800-872-6289).",
